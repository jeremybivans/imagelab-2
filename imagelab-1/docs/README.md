# ImageLab

ImageLab is a framework and application that allows students to develop image modification processors (filters)
and to experience the results visually and aurally.

The ImageLab application is provided in an **imagelab.jar** file.

An associated **filters** package is provided as a folder with source (.java) and compiled (.class) files.
The source versions serve as examples for students to write their own filters.

A sample set of images are provided in an **images** directory.

## Usage

To run ImageLab from the command line:

* Make sure the **filters** directory is _in the same directory_ as the **imagelab.jar** file.

* Then issue the command  
```java -jar imagelab.jar```  
 
 
An alternative command is: 
```java -cp ".:imagelab.jar" Run```  
 Note that on Windows platforms, the ":" character in the classpath must be changed to the ";" character.)
